#Dummy File
This file is a dummy file, both to stop the site from crashing due to me handling
the case of having no entries badly.
But also to give a practical example of how to name the files, and how they then
will show up in the engine.

Both standard Parsedown Markdown and ParsedownExtre Markdown extra should be
avalible, according to Parsedowns documentation.
